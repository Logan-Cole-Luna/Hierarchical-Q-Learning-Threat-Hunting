- Update Train.py to be up to date w/ overfit.py so overfit.py can be removed

- Update the visuals, eg network flow, transition to plotly?

- Larger data segment similar to how the subset is made in 
    preprocess where it evenly divides the data so its not all benign

- Improve reward function 

- Implement proper Q learning algorithm

- Improve data preprocessing, have the values be better normalized & encoded

- Improve training env, how should we set it up? Implement it so that the model is scaning multiple ports repeatedly 
    looking for change?

- Integrate attention into the Q Learning Model
