"""
Experience replay buffer implementation for reinforcement learning.

This module implements a circular buffer to store and sample experiences for training.
It helps break correlation between consecutive samples and enables batch learning.

Classes:
    ReplayBuffer: A fixed-size buffer to store and sample experiences.
        Experiences contain (state, action, reward, next_state, done) tuples.
